              Graduated form Hashemite university with a B.S. in Physics, then

              I worked as phsyics teatcher for about a year after graduating,
              but wasn't too fond of it. I started spending every second of my
              free time learning to code and after about 6 months I think I'm
              ready to land my first job!
